# continuous character distribution reconstructions

# requirements
This requires `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`.

# running an example
You can run the example with `python src/main.py examples/test.cont.tre`. Right now, this will simulate the data with a 20% of a bimodal distribution and 80% of Rayleigh. To run your own data, it needs to be in phylip format (this is changing to csv in just a sec) and run `python src/main.py examples/test.cont.tre examples/test.cont`.
